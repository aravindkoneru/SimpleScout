###White Paper

**Problem:** Scouting is the process of collecting and analyzing team data in order
to determine ideal alliance partners. Scouting is necessary and must be done effectively
in order to remain competitive; however, the inherent problem with the scouting process is that
it is incredibly arduous and does not always yield useful data. Some times are meticulous in their
scouting and collect accurate data that they later use to develop their strategy. These teams are entitled to their
scouting data as it is the result of their hard work, however, smaller teams or teams that don't have the ability
to collect accurate data are left at a disadvantage in regards to their strategy.

**Purpose:** To use all available resources and technologies in order to create
a tool that can aid teams in their scouting process. The scouting process is
different for every team as all teams have different criteria for their alliance partners,
but this project aims to create a tool that can be universally used.

**Goals:**
* Clean and simple user interface
* Can be hacked and changed by teams
* Code is clear and organized
* Provide teams with accurate and helpful analytics
* Accept data from teams and use said data in analytics
* Release before Week 1 competitions

**Stretch Goals/Desired Features:**
* Bulk data reading (excel?)
* Generate scouting sheets on the fly (excel?)
* Collect data from teams and push to website/database
* Enter data into scouting system using website or phone application
* Match predictions

**Conclusion:** This project is incredibly ambitious and will require both time and
patience to complete. Ultimately, the goal is to have this tool aid teams in their scouting
efforts and to improve the general availability of information within the FIRST community.
